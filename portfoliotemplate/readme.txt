Replace Placeholder Images: Locate the placeholder images in the template and replace them with your own images. Make sure your images are appropriately sized and optimized for web use.

Customize Colors: Depending on the platform, you may be able to customize colors through a graphical interface or by editing the CSS directly. Here's how you can do it:

Graphical Interface: Some website builders offer a color picker tool or a theme customization panel where you can select colors for various elements like text, backgrounds, buttons, etc.

Edit CSS: If you have access to the CSS files, you can manually edit the color codes. Look for CSS classes related to the elements you want to change (e.g., headings, links, backgrounds) and update the color properties accordingly.

Adjust Fonts (Optional): If you want to change fonts, you can usually do this through the same methods as changing colors. Some templates may allow font customization through a graphical interface, while others may require CSS editing.

Preview and Test: After making changes, preview your website to ensure everything looks and functions as expected. Test your site on different devices and browsers to ensure responsiveness and compatibility.

Publish Your Website: Once you're satisfied with the changes, publish your 
website so it's accessible to visitors. (Use https://ngrok.com/)
